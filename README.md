The etch-a-sketch project was defintely harder than the projects that came before it in the Foundations course of The Odin Project but after working on it for a couple of days, I overcame these troubles. The hardest part was probably adding the functionality for the color to gradually turn black but after learning about data-attributes, it made it easier to finish. All in all this project was really fun and I'm excited to see what's next in Foundations!
